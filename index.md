**ABOUT ME**

I am a Senior at New College of Florida studying Computer Science. I enjoy taking on complex challenges and trying to solve any issues that present themselves. I also enjoy strategy games in my free time. Computer Science is my passion in the sense that there's always a problem to solve, a different way to look at things, new ways to handle tasks, and there's always room to grow more efficiently.
